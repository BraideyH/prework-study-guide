# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

In this project I learned HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as they apply to web development. This project served as a resource and testing ground for the learning of new skills associated with web development. Through this project, I have gained the neccesary skills required to continue my education throughout this bootcamp. 


## Installation

To install this project, we first created directories and repositories, otherwise known as 'repos', in which to store all of our data for the project. Following that, we created specified branches to provide us safe environments to section off our work and make changes in smaller portions. We used assets provided by the bootcamp to base our code off of in VS Code and from there added out HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript elements to the webpage. 

## Usage

I will use this prework study guide as a storage and review area for my prework notes. 

## Credits

For this project we followed instructions and tutorials provided by the University of Kansas's Coding Bootcamp portal. 

## License
 
 For this project we used the MIT liscensure.
